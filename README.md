# stylo
stylo theme contains all of the boilerplate you need to get started building a block-based theme: 

- An stylo `theme.json` file. 
- `functions.php` with some basic setup.
- `style.css` to set up the theme.
- A separate stylesheet with all the front-end alignments you'll need. 
- An stylo `index.php`
